% description Annoying protective film on Drixoral nasal spray

It's pretty annoying to have stuffy nose. You talk funny and you can't
breathe for shit. The idiots who make Drixoral nasal spray decided to
add insult to the injury by wrapping their bottles in a crappy film
"for your protection." Thanks, dickheads! I feel protected!

First of all, you'd likely be opening that spray right after your buy
it... just out of the store... where you don't have a knife or much
of any opening tool other than your fingers. The film, however, doesn't
have any grabable, perforated section on it. There does seem to have been
an attempt at perforating a strip, but it's next to impossible to grab
it. The perforated strip is just half the problems, though...

I actually opened it at home and had access to a knife. Still, getting
that fucking film off proved to be difficult. As pics show, the thing
is akin to hard, extra-thin plastic that breaks off any time you try
to pull it. So even after I made a cut with a knife and started to pull
the fucking thing broke, and I had to repeat the process a few times.

I'm all for adding protective films, but do you people ever try to
open your own fucking products? I'm looking at you, maker of Drixoral!
You'd have to do it just once before you'd go "Hey, that's
fucking annoying! We need to fix it!" Fix it!
