I'm a simple person. The only thing I want a map to do is... TELL ME WHERE THE FUCK I AM!!

What irks me quite frequently whenever I launch Google Maps™ on my
Note 4 is that it usually witholds that information:

    class="content_pic right">

This is the default view and it's telling me I'm on *Williams* and... *16*

Problem is, I don't know what the fuck *16* is. Now, I can see there's
*Murray St.* a few blocks ahead—no one cares about it. There's
*Vodden St. E.* North-West, and *Hansen Rd. N.* to the West, and
*Southlake Blvd.* to the South, but there's no useful information on
WHERE THE FUCK I AM!

The only way to get that information is to zoom in several times
until the dumb app bothers to display the names of the streets RIGHT NEXT TO YOU, instead of the ones several blocks away, the ones you care nothing about:

And while I am at it, can I point out that's it's incredibly annoying that the app changes zoom level/position every time you turn off your screen? I what to know where the fuck I am and I want you to keep track of where the fuck I am. There's REALLY no need to zoom out to nearly city-level zoom every time I shut off the screen for a couple of minutes to preserve battery power.

Maps existed for centuries. They tell you where you are.
It's not fucking rocket science. Fucking figure it out, Google!
