![](/content-pics/blog/Kitchen-Timer-1.jpg) I first bought this timer a year ago, and it's quite decent. What annoys
me the most about it, though, is its power button.

It's really tough. You need some decent finger-muscle to move it, but
what makes it truly idiotic is the fact that it's a slider.
The timer is magnetic and you stick it on your fridge. The force
you apply to move the slider moves the timer as well, and what's worse is
that its constant movement scratches the fridge.

I recently moved, so I don't have pics of the fridge at my old place, but
after just half a year, there are highly visible scratch marks on the fridge. Were there really no push-button switches available? Did the people
who made this timer even ever try to use it for a single meal? I
doubt it.

Why do I even have to worry about turning this thing off? How about
a single push-button (even use the Start/Stop button they already
got on it) and make the timer turn on when you press that button, while
making it auto turn off after the timer stops, if I never
set the temperature?

### Additional Things

Each time you turn on the timer, it beeps two series of annoying sounds.
I wish it were a single, short beep, or at least just a single series.
I can see that they probably only got one chip that makes that
single double-series of sounds, so I can let this fly.

What I can't let go is the temperature vs. time settings. The
temperature definitely gets higher priority in the design. There
are buttons that let you adjust it up and down, while the time you can
only increase, and if you go over your target, you have to start over.

I rarely use the detachable temperature probe. Meatloaf, chicken...
that's probably it. There are plenty of almost-ready meals on the market
that you shove in the oven for X amount of minutes, and this is what
I use this timer the most for.

Would be nice to be able to freely adjust the time the way I want to,
instead of having to reset any time I shoot over. And since most
of the almost-ready meals require 20 minute cooking time, it would
be nice if the timer remembered the last time I set it for!
