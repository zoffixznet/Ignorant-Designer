I realize motion-activated crap is Ã¼ber futuristic, but this is the
case where people went too far. I don't even know whom to be pissed off
with, the people who made these retarded garbage cans or the ones
who bought them.

Here's the idea: you move your hand close to the can, it opens up,
you toss your trash and walk away, and it closes all by itself.
Fuuuuuuturistic! Eh? In reality, the fucking sensor
doesn't work half the time,
batteries die after a few weeks, and try tossing a tea bag
into this can without dripping tea all over the fucking place.

You dipshits do know they still make <a href="http://www.target.com/p/simplehuman-studio-4-5-liter-retro-step-trash-can-in-brushed-stainless-steel/-/A-14370265#prodSlot=_1_6">old-school cans where you just step
on a lever to open the can</a>; yours for just twenty bucks?
No batteries, no sensors, no annoying bullshit!

You don't need fancy electronics put into a trash can. It's just a
container. You don't have motion sensors opening your flour jar,
sugar pot, salt shaker, or your damn toilet bowl, do you? So why the
fuck would you want a motion activated trash can.

Stop buying these crappy products. Just use your head to realize this is
a bad idea and send a message to crooked product designers that you
won't put up with their shit.

Motion sensor activated garbage cans are shit.
