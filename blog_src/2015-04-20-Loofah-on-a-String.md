![](/content-pics/blog/2015-04-20-Loofah-on-a-String.jpg) There are few
things reasonable people want less than stressing out, right after a nice,
relaxing, or refreshing shower. The people who made my loofah—washcloth, shower-thing, whatever—strongly disagree.

White string on white, folded, dripping fabric: try finding that shit, while barely
awake, in a dim shower stall. Throughout the whole
process of producing it, has no one thought about this issue?
Not a person said "Hey, this fucking shit is tough to find, when
I want to hang the thing after showering"? No? At all? Well... fuck!

Before you release the infuriating shit your pea-sized brain can
come up with, try using it at least once.

Fuck! It's not rocket science!

These people got it right... figure it out, for fuck's sake!
